# Weather Dashboard

## Description

This project allows users to view the forecast for the current day and the next five days for any city in the world. This is ideal for users who are traveling and would like to make plans according to the weather. The sidebar displays recently searched cities that users can go back and reference if they so choose. I learned how to pull data from the OpenWeather API to achieve this.

## Installation

Access the weather dashboard [here](https://torfirst.github.io/weather-dashboard/). A web browser is required to access the weather dashboard. 

## Usage

Go to https://torfirst.github.io/weather-dashboard/ to view the weather dashboard. Users can simply type in a city name into the search to display the forecast. Recently searched cities will appear on the left underneath the search bar

## Credits

I used OpenWeather API to retrieve weather data. I used [this link](https://openweathermap.org/current) to retrieve the current weather for a given city, and [this link](https://openweathermap.org/forecast5) to retrieve the five day forecast. 

I referenced [this](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-convert-unix-timestamp-to-time-in-javascript/#) to convert the UNIX code to year/month/day. I also referenced [this link](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Set) to pull unique dates from an array for the forecast.

I also received some guidance from the Xpert Learning Assistant on BCS. I also referenced code from previous class activities.
